# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains my first five web design projects, developed as part of the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) from FreeCodeCamp.

These projects were created **before** I learned Git and GitHub.  
Now, as part of my learning process, I’m uploading them to this repository and gradually improving each one using version control and modern web development practices.

### 🧭 Navigation

- The main `index.html` at the root of the repository acts as a **personal portfolio**.
- From this landing page, you can access the other four FreeCodeCamp projects.
- Each project lives in its own folder with its own HTML and CSS files.
- The `personal-portfolio/` folder contains the original portfolio I built as one of the five projects, preserved separately.

## 🛠️ Improvements Underway

Now that I’ve learned Git and GitHub, I plan to:
- Clean and refactor the code
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility
- Apply semantic HTML and modern CSS practices
- Keep track of updates through clear Git commits

This repository not only hosts the projects, but also documents my growth as a developer.
